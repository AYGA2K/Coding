  <h1> Thailand </h1>
  <p>  A bucket-list vacation spot for so many people, Thailand truly has it all–the chaotic charm of Bangkok, the epic tropical jungles, some of the best street food in the world, and palm-lined beaches that seem to go on forever. Whatever your reason for escaping to the Land of Smiles, Thailand won't disappoint.

    Thailand is home to well-connected trains and budget airlines that can take you from one point of interest to the next quickly and effectively. If you're researching destinations and things to do on your next tropical vacation, check out our list of the best places to visit in Thailand.</p> 
   <h3>1-Bangkok </h3>

   <p> Thailand's capital is a fast, buzzing city of over eight million people. Known for its cosmopolitan feel and vibrant street life, Bangkok is also a great gateway to the country's best temples and palaces. And while it's easy to forget when walking among Bangkok's skyscrapers, the city's heart is on the water–the many canals networking throughout the neighborhoods and the vibrant Chao Phraya River, which you can tour on a long-tail boat cruise.

    For those in a shopping mood, Bangkok is home to many shopping centers, including über-luxurious Siam Paragon and travel-inspired Terminal21, as well as a number of traditional floating markets. For a more unique experience, nothing can beat Chatuchak Market — one of the largest outdoor markets in the world and a labyrinth of over 8000 stalls (be prepared for the inevitable experience of getting lost there), Chatuchak has it all and sells it at local prices. </p>
     <h3>2. Chiang Mai </h3>

     <p>
      Shrouded in misty, jungly mountains, Chiang Mai is one of the best destinations in Thailand for travelers looking to see a different side of the country–a city of ancient constructions, thick tropical rainforests, and hill trekking. A good way to see the wild side of Chiang Mai is to head out to Doi Inthanon National Park, which is part of the Himalayan mountain range and home to remote villages and stunning viewpoints.
