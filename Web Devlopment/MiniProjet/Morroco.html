   <p> The bustling and vibrant buzz of Marrakesh medina sums up Morocco for many visitors and is a major tourist attraction.

    The old city is entered from the vast plaza of Djemma el-fna Square where, it seems, half the city converges throughout the day and into the evening to hang out with the stall vendors, traditional musicians, snake charmers, and random acrobats. </p>
