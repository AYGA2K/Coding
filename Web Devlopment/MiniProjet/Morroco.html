  <h1> Morroco </h1>
  <p>  Morocco's top tourist attractions range from grand Roman ruins to orange-toned mud-brick kasbah architecture, which makes it one of north Africa's most interesting historic destinations. </p> 
   <h3>1-marakech </h3>

   <p> The bustling and vibrant buzz of Marrakesh medina sums up Morocco for many visitors and is a major tourist attraction.

    The old city is entered from the vast plaza of Djemma el-fna Square where, it seems, half the city converges throughout the day and into the evening to hang out with the stall vendors, traditional musicians, snake charmers, and random acrobats. </p>
     <h3> 2. Chefchaouen </h3>

     <p>Sitting snug amid the lush Rif Mountains, Chefchaouen is a labyrinth hill town of blue-on-blue buildings that has an incredibly photogenic glow.

      There isn't much actual sightseeing to be done, and that's one of the town's main attractions.
      
      A visit here is simply about wandering the medina alleys and lapping up all that colorful architecture.
      
      It's a peaceful, easygoing town and a great place to recharge for a while if you've been spending a lot of time amid the cities of Fes and Marrakesh beforehand.
      
      This is also one of Morocco's main hiking and trekking destinations and a starting point and organization center for Rif Mountains walks.
