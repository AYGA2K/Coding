  <h1> Poland </h1>
  <p>  Poland has a history that dates back almost a thousand years, with stunning medieval architecture, remnants of WWII and its devastation, and castles and palaces in every corner of the country.

    But this ancient country is also home to expansive national parks, mountains, and lakes, with seemingly endless trails cutting through virgin nature waiting to be explored.
    
    No matter why you're heading to Poland, discover the most stunning destinations with our list of the best places to visit in Poland. </p> 
   <h3>1. Krakow </h3>

   <p> One of the oldest cities in Poland, Krakow was already inhabited back in the 7th century. Because the city escaped most of the WWII destruction that fell on other Polish cities, Krakow's Old Town center still retains its stunning medieval architecture. The Wavel Castle and the historic district of Kazimierz — also known as the Old Jewish Quarter — in the area are both designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

    Krakow is home to around 40 urban parks, including 19th-century Planty Park, which covers an area of 21 hectares and forms a green ring around the city center, and the Lasek Wolski forest, which offers hiking and biking trails in a large woodland area just minutes from the city center.
    
    On rainy days, Krakow's 28 museums are a must-see, especially the National Art Collection at the Wawel, where visitors can also see period furniture, a massive collection of Flemish tapestries, the royal jewels, and a collection of weapons and armor dating back to the 15th century.
    
    For an unusual, in-depth look into ancient Krakow and its streets, there's the Rynek Underground Museum.
    <h3> 2. Warsaw </h3>

     <p>Poland's capital was left in ruins after WWII — almost 85 percent of its buildings had been turned to ash or systematically razed by Nazi forces. As soon as the war ended, the city embarked on a massive effort to reconstruct its historic center using original plans. As a result, the Baroque and Renaissance merchant houses you see today are perfect replicas of the originals.

      Although WWII also caused the loss of collections held by museums and palaces, the city is still home to over 60 museums today. In addition to art and history museums, Warsaw also offers some unusual choices, including the world's only Museum of Posters, a museum dedicated to the WWII Warsaw Uprising, a Neon Museum, and a Museum of Caricature.
      
      The National Museum, which chronicles the history of the city, also houses the largest collection of paintings in Poland — including a number of works of art that came from Adolf Hitler's private collection.
      
      Warsaw might not have as many parks as Krakow, but Lazienki Palace and its formal gardens more than make up for it. This 18th-century palace is surrounded by 76 hectares of urban forest and is home to a planetarium, an outdoor theater, pavilions, and much more.</p>
